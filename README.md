## 🧬 Concept Overview

Traditional knowledge graph (KG) construction methods suffer from brittleness when dealing with noisy, unstructured inputs. This project introduces a **self-healing knowledge graph system** inspired by biological immune systems—an autonomous framework that detects and corrects anomalies in knowledge graphs without requiring perfect initial construction.

### Key Innovation: Biological Immune System Analogy

* **Anomaly Detection**: Like immune cells detecting pathogens, diagnostic agents identify incoherent relations and malformed entities
* **Adaptive Healing**: Similar to antibody response, correction mechanisms learn and evolve over time
* **Memory Formation**: System retains knowledge about past anomalies and successful repairs
* **Locality of Reference**: Operates relative to the current graph state rather than enforcing external ideal standards

## 🎯 Research Problem

Current KG construction approaches face critical limitations:

* **Fragile Pipelines**: Non-ideal inputs (LLM outputs, casual text) create ambiguous entities like "elon and stacy" instead of discrete "Elon" and "Stacy"
* **Brittle Optimization**: Top-down methods assume ideal conditions and fail on real-world noisy data
* **Lack of Adaptability**: Systems cannot self-correct or evolve after initial construction

## 🌱 Natural Emergence Philosophy

This system exhibits **natural emergence**—robust, scalable behavior arising from simple local rules rather than explicit top-down programming. Like ant colonies optimizing paths through local interactions, the self-healing KG achieves global coherence through distributed, adaptive corrections.

## 🧪 Experimental Framework

### Experiment 1: DocRED SVO Healing *(Knowledge Graph Focus)*

**Objective**: Implement core self-healing mechanisms using DocRED dataset for document-level relation extraction.
**Approach**:

* Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) triplet extraction and healing
* Anomaly detection in relation patterns
* Automated correction of malformed entities
  **Location**: `experiments/exp1_docred_svo_healing/`

### Experiment 2: Generic Graph Healing *(Graph Type: Heterogeneous Graphs)*

**Objective**: Extend healing strategies to more general graphs beyond KGs.
**Approach**:

* Use open datasets with non-SVO structures (e.g., citation networks, social graphs)
* Test healing based on schema violations, connectivity issues, or structural anomalies
* Establish reusable FSM wrappers and modular logic for generalization
  **Location**: `experiments/exp2_generic_graphs/`

> ⚡ *More experiments will follow for different graph types: time-evolving graphs, biological networks, etc.*
