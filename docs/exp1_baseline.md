**200-word Findings (draft):**

> The initial static-SPO prototype processed 50 deliberately noisy triples. Rule R1 flagged $infected low-confidence assertions, R2 resolved duplicate functional properties, and R3 caught schema violations. $healed triples were automatically repaired, demonstrating deterministic rules can recover over *X %* of corrupted knowledge with minimal human input. The $quarantined residuals expose edge-cases—mainly low-confidence rows lacking corroboration—highlighting where probabilistic or LLM-assisted heuristics will be valuable…
